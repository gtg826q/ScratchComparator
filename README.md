ScratchComparator
=================

As part of my research assistantship during graduate school, I worked with elementary school students using Scratch, a graphical programming language used to teach computer programming. The Scratch Comparator is a project I did to develop an algorithm to compare Scratch project files for similarities. It is written in Java. Because Scratch projects can be downloaded from the internet, this program would allow teachers to check students' Scratch assignments for plagiarism. I presented this project at the 2010 ACM Mid-Southeast Fall Conference.
